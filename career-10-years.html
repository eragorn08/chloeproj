    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="Career Future Image" width="200" height="150">
    
    <p>In 10 years, I see myself as a successful software engineer, working at a leading tech company or perhaps running my own startup. My journey will begin with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Graduating from a top university with a degree in Computer Science</li>
        <li>Gaining experience through internships and projects</li>
        <li>Specializing in AI and Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Contributing to the open-source community</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My goal is to innovate and build solutions that impact people's lives positively.</p>
